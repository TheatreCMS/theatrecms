# Theatre CMS

Theatre CMS is an open-source content management system (CMS) designed specifically for the performing arts organization  to create a website to market their performances. While the name implies a focus on theatre (as that is my personal area of expertise), the architecture and terminology is suitable for any organization that provides live performances, such as dance troupes, operas, symphonies, etc.

This project is born out of the confluence of three things: my own experiences as a professional actor and musician, my day job as a web developer, and my experience building websites for three specific clients _(a theatre, an opera, and a symphony)_. As such, Theatre CMS is not a plugin for an already existing platform. It is a re imagining and completely new implementation designed to address the needs of performing arts organizations specifically.

**THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE**. As such, it is nowhere near ready for use as a production platform. At this time, it is an experiment in current technologies, consumer interest, and viability as open source software.
