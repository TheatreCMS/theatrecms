# Content Types

The application is comprised of the following content types:

- [[People]]
- [[Works]]
- [[Productions]]
- [[Seasons]]
- [[Pages]]
- [[Posts]]

With these six content types, any performing arts organization can create  a website for their organization:

-  Any one person can be associated with multiple works or productions. For example, the playwright `William Shakespeare` can be associated with both the works `Othello` and `Hamlet`, sharing the Shakespeare person post type information between them.
-  Any one work can be associated with multiple productions. For example, an ensemble could do Hamlet in 2025 and then again in 2027. That would be two different productions that could share the information regarding the play itself while have different production teams, dates, etc.
